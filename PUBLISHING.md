#### Save Token

```bash
# Store token in environment variable (recommended)
export OVSX_PAT="your-open-vsx-token-here"

# Or use directly in publish commands
ovsx publish -p YOUR_OVSX_PAT
```

## Publishing Workflow

> **Note**: This project uses `pnpm`. All publish commands include `--no-dependencies` flag for pnpm compatibility.

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Publish to VS Code Marketplace only
pnpm publish

# Publish to Open VSX only
pnpm publish:ovsx

# Publish to BOTH marketplaces
pnpm publish:all
```

### Manual Publishing (Detailed)

#### First-time Publish

```bash
# 1. Ensure code is compiled
pnpm compile

# 2. Run linter and tests
pnpm lint
pnpm test

# 3. Package locally to verify
pnpm package

# 4. Publish to VS Code Marketplace
pnpm publish
# OR with version bump:
pnpm publish:patch  # 0.1.4 → 0.1.5
pnpm publish:minor  # 0.1.4 → 0.2.0

# 5. Publish to Open VSX
pnpm publish:ovsx
```

#### Update Existing Extension

**Option 1: Version bump + dual publish**
```bash
# Bump version in package.json, then:
pnpm publish:all
```

**Option 2: Auto version increment**
```bash
# For VS Code Marketplace (auto-increments version):
pnpm publish:patch  # Bug fixes (0.1.4 → 0.1.5)
pnpm publish:minor  # New features (0.1.4 → 0.2.0)

# Then publish to Open VSX with the new version:
pnpm publish:ovsx
```

**Option 3: Manual control**
```bash
# 1. Update version in package.json manually
# 2. Publish to both:
pnpm publish        # VS Code Marketplace
pnpm publish:ovsx   # Open VSX
```

### Automated Publishing (GitHub Actions)

See `.github/workflows/publish.yml` for automated release workflow.

**Current workflow publishes to VS Code Marketplace only.**

To enable Open VSX in CI/CD:
1. Add `OVSX_PAT` to GitHub repository secrets
2. Update workflow file to include Open VSX publish step

Trigger by creating a git tag:
```bash
git tag v0.2.0
git push --tags
```

## Troubleshooting

### VS Code Marketplace Issues

**"Publisher not found"**
- Ensure you created the publisher at marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
- Publisher ID must exactly match package.json

**"Authentication failed"**
- Token may have expired - generate a new one
- Ensure token has "Marketplace (Manage)" scope
- Try re-login: `npx vsce logout && npx vsce login MarkShawn2020`

**"Extension already exists"**
- You're trying to republish the same version
- Increment version number in package.json first

### Open VSX Issues

**"Namespace not found"**
- Create namespace at https://open-vsx.org/ (Settings → Namespaces)
- Namespace must match publisher ID in package.json

**"Invalid token"**
- Generate new token at https://open-vsx.org/ (Settings → Access Tokens)
- Ensure token has publishing permissions
- Set in environment: `export OVSX_PAT="your-token"`

**"Version already exists"**
- Cannot republish same version
- Bump version in package.json before publishing

### General Issues

**Package size too large**
- Review `npx vsce ls --tree` output
- Add unnecessary files to `.vscodeignore`
- Consider removing large demo files

**Token not recognized**
- VS Code: Use `VSCE_PAT` (Azure DevOps token)
- Open VSX: Use `OVSX_PAT` (Open VSX token)
- These are different tokens for different registries!

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit tokens to git**
   - Store `VSCE_PAT` and `OVSX_PAT` in environment variables
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
   - Add token files to .gitignore

2. **Rotate tokens regularly**
   - Set expiration dates (recommend 90 days)
   - Generate new tokens periodically
   - Update GitHub Secrets when rotating

3. **Limit token scope**
   - VS Code: Only "Marketplace (Manage)" permission
   - Open VSX: Default publishing scope only
   - Don't use all-access tokens

4. **Use separate tokens**
   - Different token for each registry
   - Different tokens for local vs CI/CD

## Version Management Strategy

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **PATCH** (0.1.x): Bug fixes, typos, minor tweaks
- **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features, backwards-compatible changes
- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes

Current version: `0.1.3`

Recommended next releases:
- `0.1.4` - Bug fixes for line gutter
- `0.2.0` - New features (e.g., custom format templates)
- `1.0.0` - When API is stable and production-ready

## Useful Commands

### Package Inspection

```bash
# Check what will be packaged
npx vsce ls
npx vsce ls --tree

# Package without publishing
pnpm package

# Show package info from marketplace
npx vsce show MarkShawn2020.better-copy-path-with-lines
```

### Publishing Commands

```bash
# VS Code Marketplace
pnpm publish              # Publish current version
pnpm publish:patch        # Auto-increment patch (0.1.4 → 0.1.5)
pnpm publish:minor        # Auto-increment minor (0.1.4 → 0.2.0)

# Open VSX
pnpm publish:ovsx         # Publish to Open VSX

# Both registries
pnpm publish:all          # Publish to both at once
```

### Token Management

```bash
# VS Code Marketplace
npx vsce login MarkShawn2020
npx vsce logout

# Open VSX (uses environment variable)
export OVSX_PAT="your-token"
```

### Unpublish (use with caution!)

```bash
# VS Code Marketplace
npx vsce unpublish MarkShawn2020.better-copy-path-with-lines

# Open VSX (not recommended - contact support)
```
